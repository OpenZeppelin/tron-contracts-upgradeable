/**
 * @dev Mock that mimics TRON USDT (`TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t`) with its transfer fee enabled.
 *
 * Like {TRC20USDTMock}, `transfer` performs the transfer (reverting on failure) but returns `false` on success.
 * Additionally, it reproduces Tether's fee model: the sender is debited the full `value`, the recipient is
 * credited `value - fee`, and `fee` is routed to a collector. This lets us exercise the case where USDT's fee
 * is switched on, which makes a recipient-balance-delta check reject an otherwise-successful transfer.
