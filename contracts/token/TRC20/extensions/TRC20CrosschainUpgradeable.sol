/**
 * @dev Extension of {TRC20} that makes it natively cross-chain using the TRC-7786 based {BridgeFungible}.
 *
 * This extension makes the token compatible with counterparts on other chains, which can be:
 * * {TRC20Crosschain} instances,
 * * {TRC20} instances that are bridged using {BridgeTRC20},
 * * {TRC20Bridgeable} instances that are bridged using {BridgeTRC7802}.
 *
 * It is mostly equivalent to inheriting from both {TRC20Bridgeable} and {BridgeTRC7802}, and configuring them such
 * that:
 * * `token` (on the {BridgeTRC7802} side) is `address(this)`,
 * * `_checkTokenBridge` (on the {TRC20Bridgeable} side) is implemented such that it only accepts self-calls.
